🎮 **Rusted Rhythms** is a VR rhythm-based exploration game built with Unity, in which players enter a desolate factory and use intuitive XR interaction to compose music by tapping various objects. The project was designed to balance immersive spatial audio with playful interaction mechanics.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Immersive VR interaction**: Dual locomotion (teleport & continuous), realistic grabbing, and hand-animated models.
- **Rhythmic audio system**: Objects produce unique sounds, some loop when struck, allowing live music layering.
- **Steam Audio integration**: Creates realistic 3D spatial sound for an engaging and directional audio experience.
- **Surprise feedback & animations**: Includes “paradox of suspense” elements like a radio that triggers a dramatic alien invasion cutscene.
- **Hand Menu UI**: Let users change movement styles and control playback without breaking immersion.

### 🔍 Summary
The game received positive feedback for its sound design and rhythm-based mechanics, though it was noted that scene variety, guidance, and environmental interaction could be improved. The team made iterative changes based on user feedback, showing the importance of player-centered VR design.
