🛡️ **Toybox Defense VR** is a room-scale VR tower defense game developed using Unity and Oculus Quest 2. Players place turrets and use blasters to stop waves of invading enemies from reaching the central core in a stylized toy world. The project emphasizes spatial planning, physical interaction, and visual feedback for player immersion.

### 🎮 Core Features
- **VR-native tower defense mechanics**: Players physically place turrets on a toy platform in front of them, with real-time feedback and intuitive XR interaction.
- **Mixed defense strategy**: Use both deployable turrets and handheld blasters to defend the core.
- **Progressive enemy waves**: Multiple rounds of increasing difficulty and enemy variety to challenge player strategy.
- **Visual & audio feedback**: Includes VFX like damage popups, turret feedback lights, and 3D sound effects using Steam Audio.
- **Hand UI & Object Pooling**: A polished floating hand menu to track health, gold, and manage game start, plus efficient object pooling for performance.

### 👥 Team Contributions
- **Alicia (xiaohan233)**:  
  XR Origin setup, object grabbing, turret placement, and hand menu interface logic.
- **Chris**:  
  UI systems, object pooling logic, camera setups, and input optimization.
- **Matt**:  
  VFX, 3D modeling, sound effects, and difficulty balancing.
- **Jack**:  
  Enemy spawn system, navigation mesh logic, and enemy wave design.

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Designing for **VR interaction** requires constant iteration on spatial layout and input clarity.
- **Object pooling and audio optimization** significantly improved performance and immersion.
- **Team coordination** using Git, Trello, and stand-ups allowed parallel development across gameplay, UI, and design.
